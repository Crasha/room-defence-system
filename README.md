# room-defence-system
A Raspberry Pi, a Gertboard, a Pi Camera for face recognition and a giant Nerf Rifle!

This project works in conjunction with Tony DiCola's Raspberry Pi powered box which uses face recognition with OpenCV to lock and unlock itself. https://github.com/tdicola/pi-facerec-box 

The software depends on a particular hardware setup, which includes a Raspberry Pi camera, GPIO lines connected to buttons and LEDs. The complete system is able to protect a room by checking faces and activating defences when an unrecognised intruder is detected.
